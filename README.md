An experimental project (waffles)

Welcome to Mining Game, a new experimental game by BottleFact (also known by the name of Dan, as may be referenced here)
This game is not intended to be any form of copy of Minecraft, Roblox, Blockland, Terraria, Unturned or similar voxel based games.

The game is licensed with MIT, so go take that code and have fun!
